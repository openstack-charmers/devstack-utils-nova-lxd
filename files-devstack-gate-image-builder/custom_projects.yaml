## The openstack-repos element caches every git repo, wihch can take
## quite some time.  We can override this, but some minimal repos are
## required for a successful build.  For speeding up builds when
## you're testing the following should work, but be very careful
## stripping things out when generating real images.

## add to /tmp/custom_projects.yaml:

## - project: openstack-infra/project-config
